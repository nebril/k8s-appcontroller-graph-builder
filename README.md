To run, just open `index.html` in directory of your local copy using `gnome-open index.html` under unixoids, `open index.html` under macs, or just clicking it in file browser of your system/choice.

You can also serve this directory from http, e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and load `0.0.0.0:9000` in your browser.
